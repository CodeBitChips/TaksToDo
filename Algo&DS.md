### Types of Data Structures
There are two types of data structures:

### Primitive data structure
- Non-primitive data structure
- Primitive Data structure

The primitive data structures are primitive data types. The int, char, float, double, and pointer are the primitive data structures that can hold a single value.

### Non-Primitive Data structure

The non-primitive data structure is divided into two types:

- Linear data structure
- Non-linear data structure
- Linear Data Structure

The arrangement of data in a sequential manner is known as a linear data structure. The data structures used for this purpose are Arrays, Linked list, Stacks, and Queues. In these data structures, one element is connected to only one another element in a linear form.

When one element is connected to the 'n' number of elements known as a non-linear data structure. The best example is trees and graphs. In this case, the elements are arranged in a random manner.

### Major Operations
The major or the common operations that can be performed on the data structures are:

- Searching: We can search for any element in a data structure.
- Sorting: We can sort the elements of a data structure either in an ascending or descending order.
- Insertion: We can also insert the new element in a data structure.
- Updation: We can also update the element, i.e., we can replace the element with another element.
- Deletion: We can also perform the delete operation to remove the element from the data structure.

Let’s first list the most commonly used data structures, and then we’ll cover them one by one:

1. Arrays
2. Stacks
3. Queues
4. Linked Lists
5. Trees
6. Graphs
7. Tries (they are effectively trees, but it’s still good to call them out separately).
8. Hash Tables
